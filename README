= RubyTSK

== Description

This is a simple ruby module to provide access to the The SleuthKit digital forensics libraries.
The library offers methods to safely examine disk images, volume systems, partitions, file systems and their
contents.

== Examples

require 'sleuthkit'

# open a disk
tskimage = Sleuthkit::Image.new('path/to/disk.image')
tskimage.inspect_object

# open a volume within a disk
tskvolume = Sleuthkit::Volume.new(tskimage)
 => #<Sleuthkit::VolumeSystem:0x104f051b8>

#display specific volume system information
tskvolume.partition_count
 => 6 

#grab a partition
tskvolume.volume.partition[0]
 => #<Sleuthkit::VolumePart:0x1094d3618> 


== Installation

Install (RVM https://rvm.io/ recommended for managing gems):

to load ruby dependencies: 'bundle'

rake build     (prepares the gem for installation from sleuthkit.gemspec)
rake compile   (compiles the gem in the 'pkg' directory; handy for running tests)
rake install   (puts the gem in your local gem repository)

== Dependencies

Requirements: The SleuthKit C library (install with your favorite package manager)
Mac:      'brew install sleuthkit'

== TESTING

RubyTSK is built using the RSpec testing DSL, available via the Rake build tool.

rake spec
OR
rake -T spec:suite  (displays suites of test that can be run independently)

Compressed test images are found in the 'data' directory, to unpack:

rake spec:samples:split             # splits a sample for use in tests
rake spec:samples:uncompress[file]  # Uncompress sample disk images (default = all images in 'data')
